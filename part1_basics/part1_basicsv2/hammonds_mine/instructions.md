# John Hammond's Mine

Loe and behold, some data from John Hammond's Jurassic Park dinosaur DNA digs has been found! Let's do some digging to learn about what he found.

**Objectives:**

 - Work with arrays, objects, and enumeration.
 - Familiarize with data access using brackets and dot notation.

**Process:**

1. Check out the provided JavaScript (in the script tag). You'll find a very large (and deep!) `mine` data structure.

2. Write JavaScript to solve the following digging challenges. When you have solved for a value, print it out into the console.

## Digging challenges...

1. **Number of dig sites worldwide.**

2. **Total contributions given by donors.**

3. **Number of ACTIVE dig sites worldwide.**

4. **Total number of finds in North America.**

5. **Total Brachiosaurus specimens found worldwide.**

All of these challenges are solvable with `for` loops.  
Good luck, and happy digging!
