# Deck o' Cards

Let's make a standard deck of playing cards... as JavaScript.

**Objectives:**

 - Work with arrays and enumeration.
 - Create simple object structures.

**Process:**

1. Check out the provided JavaScript (in the script tag). You'll find a `values` and `suits` array, each filled with standard playing card attributes. Also note the empty `deck` array... that will hold our 52 cards.

3. Compose an algorithm that enumerates both `values` and `suits`. Create a new object for each value/suit pairing, and add it to the `deck` array. These card objects should be formatted as:

```
{value: 3, suit: 'S'}
```

The `deck` array should print out into the JavaScript console. It should be filled with 52 object, each with a unique `value` and `suit` combination.

## Bonus

- Loop through your deck, and print out each value/suit pairing as a string on a separate line in the JavaScript console.
