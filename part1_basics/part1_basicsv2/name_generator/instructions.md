# Name Generator

Here's a fun little exercise to one-up the legendary name of Benedict Cumberbatch.

**Objectives:**

 - Work with data arrays.
 - Familiarize with `Math` functions and order of operations.
 - Select and modify DOM elements.
 - Bind DOM events to capture user interactions.

**Process:**

1. Check out the provided JavaScript (in the script tag). You'll find a `firstNames` and `lastNames` array, each filled with awesome names.

2. Select a random first and last name from each of the arrays. You may need to look up documentation for JavaScript's `Math.random()` and `Math.round()` functions.

3. Combine your randomly selected first and last names into a single string, and set that as the contents of the `#name-text` element.

4. Add a click event listener to the `#name-bttn` element. Perform steps 2 & 3 whenever the button is clicked.
