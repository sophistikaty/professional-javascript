## scope

Open/run the `scope.html` file. Take 5 minutes and read through the JavaScript. What do you expect will be printed to the console? Then examine the console output and explain why each line of the output prints what it does. Play will commenting and uncommenting different lines and think about what the `var` keyword does.
